## My process

I started by placing everything inide a div with the class container, then I added the semantic elements of html giving each a unique class (even though they might've been redundant).
In CSS I went with an outside-in flow, targeting the major things instead of the small ones. The body style was first, then the container, the image, and the text elements. 
Because I did not have access to the original measurements I had to eyeball everything so every measurement is pretty contrived in order to fit best according to the original image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned



```html
<h1>I'm proud to have built something</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```




### Continued development

I'd definitely love to understand flexbox and css grid more as well as being able to deliver precise properties without the consant need for readjusting and finagling every small detail so that it fits.


### Useful resources

- (https://w3schools.com) - This helped me to deal with css properties like box-shadow and border-radius, along with any other question that popped up during the making of this.
- (https://www.htmlcheatsheet.com) - This site has many offshoots (of css, java , etc) that help with fine-tuning some properties.
